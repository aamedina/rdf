# D3FEND

## :d3fend/D3FENDThing
The `:d3fend/D3FENDThing` class in the D3FEND ontology represents
concepts defined in the core D3FEND Framework. It is a subclass of
itself, `:d3fend/D3FENDThing`.

However, there are no direct properties (slots) associated with
`:d3fend/D3FENDThing`. This suggests that this class serves as a
high-level or root class in the D3FEND ontology, and specific
properties would be associated with its subclasses.

In a real-world scenario, you would use this class as a starting point
for defining more specific classes in the D3FEND ontology. For
example, you might define subclasses of `:d3fend/D3FENDThing` to
represent specific types of cybersecurity concepts, such as attacks,
defenses, or vulnerabilities. Each of these subclasses could then have
its own properties to describe the specific attributes of those
concepts.

When storing this data in Datomic with RDF, you would typically map
these D3FEND classes to Datomic entities. Each D3FEND class would
become a Datomic entity with the `:db/ident` attribute set to the IRI
of the class. The properties of the class would become attributes of
the Datomic entity. This way, you can leverage the power of Datomic
for querying and managing your cybersecurity data, while still using
the structure and semantics of the D3FEND ontology.

## :d3fend/ATTACKThing

The `:d3fend/ATTACKThing` class in the D3FEND ontology represents
concepts defined in the ATT&CK Framework.

## :d3fend/ATTACKMitigation

The `:d3fend/ATTACKMitigation` class in the D3FEND ontology represents
mitigations that can be applied to counteract or prevent cyber
attacks. It is a subclass of `:d3fend/ATTACKThing` and
`:d3fend/ATTACKMitigation`.

Here are the properties (slots) associated with `:d3fend/ATTACKMitigation`:

1. `:d3fend/d3fend-comment`: This property allows for the addition of
   a public note about the entity from the D3FEND team. It is a
   datatype property, meaning its values are data values (as opposed
   to object values, which are other entities).

2. `:d3fend/semantic-relation`: This property represents a semantic
   relationship between entities. It is an object property, meaning
   its values are other entities.

In a real-world scenario, you would use these properties to describe
your mitigations. For example, you could use the
`:d3fend/d3fend-comment` property to add notes about the mitigation,
or the `:d3fend/semantic-relation` property to link the mitigation to
related concepts, such as the attacks it mitigates or the defensive
techniques it involves.

The `:d3fend/ATTACKMitigation` class in the D3FEND ontology has
several descendants, each representing a specific mitigation strategy
defined in the ATT&CK Framework. 

Each of these descendants represents a specific mitigation strategy
that can be applied to counteract or prevent cyber attacks. The
specific details of each mitigation strategy would be defined by the
properties of the corresponding class.

### :d3fend/MandatoryAccessControl

Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a defensive technique that controls access to local computer system resources with kernel-level capabilities. It restricts the creation of processes and is associated with the following digital artifacts:

- :d3fend/Process: A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. It contains the program code and its current activity. Depending on the operating system (OS), a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently.

- :d3fend/CreateProcess: A process spawn refers to a function that loads and executes a new child process. The current process may wait for the child to terminate or may continue to execute asynchronously. Creating a new subprocess requires enough memory in which both the child process and the current program can execute.

- :d3fend/UserAccount: A user account allows a user to authenticate to a system and potentially to receive authorization to access resources provided by or connected to that system; however, authentication does not imply authorization. To log into an account, a user is typically required to authenticate oneself with a password or other credentials for the purposes of accounting, security, logging, and resource management.

- :d3fend/ExecutableBinary: An executable binary contains machine code instructions for a physical CPU. D3FEND also considers byte code for a virtual machine to be binary code. This is in contrast to executable scripts written in a scripting language.

- :d3fend/Thread: A thread in computing is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler.

In the context of defending a linked data platform using Datomic, these techniques can be applied as follows:

- :d3fend/ExecutableBinary: Ensure that only authorized executable binaries are allowed to run in the system where Datomic is running. This could involve using security software to monitor and control the execution of binaries.

- :d3fend/Thread: Monitor and control the creation and execution of
  threads in the system where Datomic is running. This could involve
  using security software that has capabilities for thread-level
  monitoring and control.

## :d3fend/M1053 - Data Backup

The metaobject :d3fend/M1053 represents a mitigation technique in the D3Fend framework, specifically "Data Backup". The definition of :d3fend/M1053 is "Comprehensive IT disaster recovery plans are outside the current scope of D3FEND."

In the context of defending a linked data platform using Datomic, the concept of data backup is crucial. Regularly backing up your Datomic databases ensures that you can recover your data in the event of a data loss incident. 

Here are some strategies you can employ:

- **Regular Backups**: Schedule regular backups of your Datomic databases. The frequency of backups will depend on your specific needs and the amount of data you can afford to lose in the event of a disaster.

- **Offsite Storage**: Store your backups in a location separate from your primary data center. This ensures that your backups are safe even if a disaster affects your primary location.

- **Backup Validation**: Regularly test your backups to ensure that they can be successfully restored. This can help you catch any issues with the backup process before a real disaster strikes.

- **Versioning**: Keep multiple versions of your backups. This allows you to restore from a specific point in time and can be useful if a problem is not immediately detected.

- **Encryption**: Encrypt your backups to protect them from unauthorized access. This is especially important if your backups are stored offsite or in the cloud.

Remember, while data backup is a crucial part of any disaster recovery
plan, it's also important to have strategies in place for quickly
restoring your systems and getting back to normal operations after a
disaster.
