# D3FEND

## :d3fend/D3FENDThing
The `:d3fend/D3FENDThing` class in the D3FEND ontology represents
concepts defined in the core D3FEND Framework. It is a subclass of
itself, `:d3fend/D3FENDThing`.

However, there are no direct properties (slots) associated with
`:d3fend/D3FENDThing`. This suggests that this class serves as a
high-level or root class in the D3FEND ontology, and specific
properties would be associated with its subclasses.

In a real-world scenario, you would use this class as a starting point
for defining more specific classes in the D3FEND ontology. For
example, you might define subclasses of `:d3fend/D3FENDThing` to
represent specific types of cybersecurity concepts, such as attacks,
defenses, or vulnerabilities. Each of these subclasses could then have
its own properties to describe the specific attributes of those
concepts.

When storing this data in Datomic with RDF, you would typically map
these D3FEND classes to Datomic entities. Each D3FEND class would
become a Datomic entity with the `:db/ident` attribute set to the IRI
of the class. The properties of the class would become attributes of
the Datomic entity. This way, you can leverage the power of Datomic
for querying and managing your cybersecurity data, while still using
the structure and semantics of the D3FEND ontology.

## :d3fend/ATTACKThing

The `:d3fend/ATTACKThing` class in the D3FEND ontology represents
concepts defined in the ATT&CK Framework.

## :d3fend/ATTACKMitigation

The `:d3fend/ATTACKMitigation` class in the D3FEND ontology represents
mitigations that can be applied to counteract or prevent cyber
attacks. It is a subclass of `:d3fend/ATTACKThing` and
`:d3fend/ATTACKMitigation`.

Here are the properties (slots) associated with `:d3fend/ATTACKMitigation`:

1. `:d3fend/d3fend-comment`: This property allows for the addition of
   a public note about the entity from the D3FEND team. It is a
   datatype property, meaning its values are data values (as opposed
   to object values, which are other entities).

2. `:d3fend/semantic-relation`: This property represents a semantic
   relationship between entities. It is an object property, meaning
   its values are other entities.

In a real-world scenario, you would use these properties to describe
your mitigations. For example, you could use the
`:d3fend/d3fend-comment` property to add notes about the mitigation,
or the `:d3fend/semantic-relation` property to link the mitigation to
related concepts, such as the attacks it mitigates or the defensive
techniques it involves.

The `:d3fend/ATTACKMitigation` class in the D3FEND ontology has
several descendants, each representing a specific mitigation strategy
defined in the ATT&CK Framework. 

Each of these descendants represents a specific mitigation strategy
that can be applied to counteract or prevent cyber attacks. The
specific details of each mitigation strategy would be defined by the
properties of the corresponding class.

### Vulnerability Scanning

The `:d3fend/M1016` - Vulnerability Scanning mitigation in the D3FEND
ontology represents the concept of scanning and inventorying domains
for vulnerabilities. The comment associated with this mitigation
indicates that future D3FEND releases will model the scanning and
inventory domains.

In a real-world scenario, you would use this mitigation to identify
potential vulnerabilities in your linked data platform. This could
involve using vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential
security issues, such as outdated software, misconfigurations, or
known vulnerabilities. Once identified, these vulnerabilities can be
addressed to improve the security of the platform.

For example, if you have a mitigation with the ident `:mit1`, you could add the following facts:

```
[[:db/add :mit1 :d3fend/d3fend-comment "This mitigation involves scanning and inventorying domains for vulnerabilities"]]
```

This fact states that the mitigation `:mit1` involves scanning and
inventorying domains for vulnerabilities.

   transaction. It can help to prevent replay attacks, in which an
   attacker intercepts a password and tries to reuse it later.

2. `:d3fend/StrongPasswordPolicy`: This technique involves
   implementing a policy that requires the use of strong
   passwords. Strong passwords are typically longer, include a mix of
   different types of characters, and are not easily guessable.

In the context of defending a linked data platform using Datomic,
these techniques can be applied as follows:

- `:d3fend/One-timePassword`: Implement a system that generates
  one-time passwords for users when they log in. This could involve
  sending a one-time password to the user's registered email address
  or mobile number, or generating a one-time password using a hardware
  or software token. In Datomic, you could store information about the
  one-time passwords that have been generated and used, to ensure that
  they are not reused.

- `:d3fend/StrongPasswordPolicy`: Implement a policy that requires
  users to create strong passwords. This could involve checking
  passwords against certain criteria when they are created, and
  rejecting passwords that do not meet these criteria. In Datomic, you
  could store information about the password policy, and use this
  information to check passwords when they are created.

### Operating System Configuration

The `:d3fend/M1028` - Operating System Configuration mitigation in the
D3FEND ontology represents the concept of configuring the operating
system to improve security. This mitigation is associated with the

defined as a LAN.

In the context of defending a linked data platform using Datomic,
Broadcast Domain Isolation can be applied as follows:

- **Network Segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to isolate
  different parts of your network. This can prevent a potential
  attacker from moving laterally across your network if they manage to
  compromise a single host.

- **Firewall Rules:** Set up firewall rules to restrict the broadcast
  traffic on your network. This can prevent potential attackers from
  using broadcast traffic to discover other hosts on your network.

- **Virtual LANs (VLANs):** Use VLANs to logically separate different
  parts of your network into separate broadcast domains. This can
  provide an additional layer of isolation and security for your
  Datomic servers.

### :d3fend/M1031 - Network Intrusion Prevention

  traffic originating from a private host or enclave destined towards
  untrusted networks.

In the context of defending a linked data platform using Datomic,
these techniques can be applied as follows:

- **:d3fend/NetworkTrafficAnalysis:** Regularly analyze the network
  traffic to your Datomic servers. This could involve using network
  monitoring tools to detect any unusual patterns or potential
  threats. If you notice a sudden increase in traffic or a pattern
  that matches known attack signatures, it could be an indication of a
  potential attack.

- **:d3fend/InboundTrafficFiltering:** Configure network firewalls to
  restrict inbound traffic to only trusted sources. This can be done
  by setting up firewall rules that only allow traffic from known IP
  addresses or ranges. This can prevent potential attackers from
  sending malicious traffic to your Datomic servers.

- **:d3fend/OutboundTrafficFiltering:** Similarly, restrict outbound
  traffic from your Datomic servers to trusted networks only. This can
  prevent data exfiltration in case an attacker manages to compromise
  your servers.

Remember, the goal of network intrusion prevention is not only to
detect attacks but also to stop them from succeeding. This involves
not only monitoring and analyzing network traffic but also taking
proactive measures to restrict traffic and isolate your servers from
potential threats.

### :d3fend/M1032 - Multi-factor Authentication

Multi-factor Authentication is a mitigation technique in the D3FEND framework. This technique requires proof of two or more pieces of evidence in order to authenticate a user. It is associated with :d3fend/UserAccount, which represents a digital identity represented by a set of attributes associated with a user of a given system.

In the context of defending a linked data platform using Datomic, Multi-factor Authentication can be applied as follows:

- **User Authentication:** Implement multi-factor authentication for
  all users accessing your Datomic database. This could involve
  requiring users to provide something they know (like a password),
  something they have (like a hardware token or a code sent to their
  mobile device), and something they are (like a fingerprint or other
  biometric data).

- **System Administration:** Require multi-factor authentication for
  all administrative actions on your Datomic servers. This can help to
  prevent unauthorized administrative access, which could lead to
  serious security breaches.

- **Monitoring and Auditing:** Use Datomic's auditing capabilities to
  keep track of all authentication attempts. This can help you to
  identify any unusual patterns, such as a high number of failed
  authentication attempts, which could indicate a potential attack.

Remember, the goal of multi-factor authentication is to make it more
difficult for an attacker to gain unauthorized access to your
system. Even if an attacker manages to obtain one factor (like a
user's password), they will still need to obtain the other factors in
order to gain access. This can significantly increase the security of
your system.
