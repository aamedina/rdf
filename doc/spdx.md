## Document
The `:spdx/SpdxDocument` class represents an SPDX document, which is a summary of the contents, provenance, ownership, and licensing analysis of a specific software package. Here's a breakdown of its properties:

1. **:spdx/referencesFile**: This property indicates that a particular file belongs as part of the set of analyzed files in the SPDX document. It's important to note that this property has been replaced by a relationship between the SPDX document and file with a "contains" relationship type.

2. **:spdx/dataLicense**: This property indicates the license under which the SPDX-Metadata in the SPDX document is made available. SPDX-Metadata includes data related to the SPDX fields and any explanatory text provided in the SPDX document.

3. **:spdx/externalDocumentRef**: This property identifies any external SPDX documents referenced within this SPDX document.

4. **:spdx/describesPackage**: This property relates an SPDX document to the package which it describes.

5. **:spdx/creationInfo**: This property relates an SPDX document to a set of information about the creation of the SPDX document.

6. **:spdx/hasExtractedLicensingInfo**: This property indicates that a particular ExtractedLicensingInfo was defined in the SPDX document.

7. **:spdx/reviewed**: This property has been deprecated since SPDX version 2.0. It has been replaced by an Annotation with an annotation type review.

8. **:spdx/specVersion**: This property provides a reference number that can be used to understand how to parse and interpret the rest of the SPDX document.

9. **:spdx/name**: This property identifies the name of the SPDX document.

10. **:spdx/annotation**: This property provides additional information about an SPDX document.

11. **:rdfs/comment**: This property provides a description of the SPDX document.

12. **:spdx/relationship**: This property defines a relationship between two SPDX elements. The SPDX element may be a Package, File, or SPDX document.

In a Datomic-based Linked Data Platform, you would use these properties to manage your SPDX documents. For example, you could use `:spdx/referencesFile` to indicate which files belong to the set of analyzed files in your SPDX documents, `:spdx/dataLicense` to specify the license under which the SPDX-Metadata in your SPDX documents is made available, and `:spdx/externalDocumentRef` to identify any external SPDX documents referenced within your SPDX documents.

You could also use `:spdx/describesPackage` to relate your SPDX documents to the packages they describe, `:spdx/creationInfo` to provide information about the creation of your SPDX documents, and `:spdx/hasExtractedLicensingInfo` to indicate which ExtractedLicensingInfo was defined in your SPDX documents.

Furthermore, you could use `:spdx/specVersion` to provide a reference number for your SPDX documents, `:spdx/name` to identify your SPDX documents, `:spdx/annotation` to provide additional information about your SPDX documents, `:rdfs/comment` to provide descriptions of your SPDX documents, and `:spdx/relationship` to define relationships between your SPDX elements.

17. **:spdx/sourceInfo**: Allows the producer(s) of the SPDX document to describe how the package was acquired and/or changed from the original source.

18. **:spdx/primaryPackagePurpose**: Information about the primary purpose of the identified package.

19. **:spdx/downloadLocation**: The URI at which this package is available for download.

20. **:spdx/licenseConcluded**: The licensing that the preparer of this SPDX document has concluded, based on the evidence, actually applies to the SPDX Item.

21. **:spdx/relationship**: Defines a relationship between two SPDX elements. The SPDX element may be a Package, File, or SpdxDocument.

22. **:spdx/licenseInfoFromFiles**: The licensing information that was discovered directly within the package.

23. **:rdfs/comment**: A description of the subject resource.

24. **:spdx/name**: Identify name of this SpdxElement.

25. **:spdx/attributionText**: This field provides a place for the SPDX data creator to record acknowledgements that may be required to be communicated in some contexts.

26. **:spdx/licenseComments**: The licenseComments property allows the preparer of the SPDX document to describe why the licensing in spdx:licenseConcluded was chosen.

27. **:spdx/copyrightText**: The text of copyright declarations recited in the package, file, or snippet.
