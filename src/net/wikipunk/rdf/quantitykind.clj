   "Note that the absorbed dose is not a good indicator of the likely biological effect. 1 Gy of alpha radiation would be much more biologically damaging than 1 Gy of photon radiation for example. Appropriate weighting factors can be applied reflecting the different relative biological effects to find the equivalent dose. The risk of stoctic effects due to radiation exposure can be quantified using the effective dose, which is a weighted average of the equivalent dose to each organ depending upon its radiosensitivity. When ionising radiation is used to treat cancer, the doctor will usually prescribe the radiotherapy treatment in Gy. When risk from ionising radiation is being discussed, a related unit, the Sievert is used.",

   "An action is usually an integral over time. But for action pertaining to fields, it may be integrated over spatial variables as well. In some cases, the action is integrated along the path followed by the physical system.  If the action is represented as an integral over time, taken a the path of the system between the initial time and the final time of the development of the system.\nThe evolution of a physical system between two states is determined by requiring the action be minimized or, more generally, be stationary for small perturbations about the true evolution. This requirement leads to differential equations that describe the true evolution. Conversely, an action principle is a method for reformulating differential equations of motion for a physical system as an equivalent integral equation. Although several variants have been defined (see below), the most commonly used action principle is Hamilton's principle.",

The BMI has been used as a guideline for defining whether a person is overweight because it minimizes the effect of height, but it does not take into consideration other important factors, such as age and body build. The BMI has also been used as an indicator of obesity on the assumption that the higher the index, the greater the level of body fat.",

In such cases it is conventional to choose the reference point to be the center of mass of the system or the center of charge, not some arbitrary origin.

   "\"Electric Polarization\" is the relative shift of positive and negative electric charge in opposite directions within an insulator, or dielectric, induced by an external electric field. Polarization occurs when an electric field distorts the negative cloud of electrons around positive atomic nuclei in a direction opposite the field. This slight separation of charge makes one side of the atom somewhat positive and the opposite side somewhat negative. In some materials whose molecules are permanently polarized by chemical forces, such as water molecules, some of the polarization is caused by molecules rotating into the same alignment under the influence of the electric field. One of the measures of polarization is electric dipole moment, which equals the distance between the slightly shifted centres of positive and negative charge multiplied by the amount of one of the charges. Polarization P in its quantitative meaning is the amount of dipole moment p per unit volume V of a polarized material, P = p/V.",

(def ElectromagneticPermeability
  "\"Permeability} is the degree of magnetization of a material that responds linearly to an applied magnetic field. In general permeability is a tensor-valued quantity. The definition given applies to an isotropic medium. For an anisotropic medium permeability is a second order tensor. In electromagnetism, permeability is the measure of the ability of a material to support the formation of a magnetic field within itself. In other words, it is the degree of magnetization that a material obtains in response to an applied magnetic field. Magnetic permeability is typically represented by the Greek letter \\(\\mu\\). The term was coined in September, 1885 by Oliver Heaviside. The reciprocal of magnetic permeability is \\textit{Magnetic Reluctivity\"."

The repetition of the events may be periodic (that is. the length of time between event repetitions is fixed) or aperiodic (i.e. the length of time between event repetitions varies). Therefore, we distinguish between periodic and aperiodic frequencies. In the SI system, periodic frequency is measured in hertz (Hz) or multiples of hertz, while aperiodic frequency is measured in becquerel (Bq). In spectroscopy, \\(\\nu\\) is mostly used. Light passing through different media keeps its frequency, but not its wavelength or wavenumber."

   "Information Entropy is a concept from information theory. It tells how much information there is in an event. In general, the more uncertain or random the event is, the more information it will contain. The concept of information entropy was created by a mathematician. He was named Claude Elwood Shannon. It has applications in many areas, including lossless data compression, statistical inference, cryptography and recently in other disciplines as biology, physics or machine learning.",

   "\"Internal Energy\" is simply its energy. \"internal\" refers to the fact that some energy contributions are not considered. For instance, when the total system is in uniform motion, it has kinetic energy. This overall kinetic energy is never seen as part of the internal energy; one could call it external energy. Or, if the system is at constant non-zero height above the surface the Earth, it has constant potential energy in the gravitational field of the Earth. Gravitational energy is only taken into account when it plays a role in the phenomenon of interest, for instance in a colloidal suspension, where the gravitation influences the up- downward motion of the small particles comprising the colloid. In all other cases, gravitational energy is assumed not to contribute to the internal energy; one may call it again external energy.",

Molecules further from the boundary collide with molecules that have struck the boundary, further transferring the change in momentum into the interior of the fluid. This transfer of momentum is molecular viscosity. Molecules, however, travel only micrometers between collisions, and the process is very inefficient for transferring momentum even a few centimeters. Molecular viscosity is important only within a few millimeters of a boundary. The coefficient of molecular viscosity has the same value as the dynamic viscosity.",

As the reacting molecules (or moieties) consist of a definite set of atoms in an integer ratio, the ratio between reactants in a complete reaction is also in integer ratio. A reaction may consume more than one molecule, and the \"Stoichiometric Number\" counts this number, defined as positive for products (added) and negative for reactants (removed).",

   "In any branch of science dealing with materials and their behaviour, strain is the geometrical expression of deformation caused by the action of stress on a physical body. Strain is calculated by first assuming a change between two body states: the beginning state and the final state. Then the difference in placement of two points in this body in those two states expresses the numerical value of strain. Strain therefore expresses itself as a change in size and/or shape.

Turbidity in open water is often caused by phytoplankton and the measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality. The higher the turbidity, the higher the risk of the drinkers developing gastrointestinal diseases, especially for immune-compromised people, because contaminants like virus or bacteria can become attached to the suspended solid. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with chlorine because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly suspended solids can protect bacteria from UV sterilisation of water. Fluids can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the settleable solids), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.",

When the stored energy increases, so does the length of the molecular bonds. As a result, solids typically expand in response to heating and contract on cooling; this dimensional response to temperature change is expressed by its coefficient of thermal expansion.\n\nDifferent coefficients of thermal expansion can be defined for a substance depending on whether the expansion is measured by:\n\n    * linear thermal expansion\n    * area thermal expansion\n    * volumetric thermal expansion\n\nThese characteristics are closely related. The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be defined for both liquids and solids. The linear thermal expansion can only be defined for solids, and is common in engineering applications.\n\nSome substances expand when cooled, such as freezing water, so they have negative thermal expansion coefficients.

   "A force is said to do Work when it acts on a body so that there is a displacement of the point of application, however small, in the direction of the force.  The concepts of work and energy are closely tied to the concept of force because an applied force can do work on an object and cause a change in energy. Energy is defined as the ability to do work. Work is done on an object when an applied force moves it through a distance. Kinetic energy is the energy of an object in motion. The net work is equal to the change in kinetic energy.",
