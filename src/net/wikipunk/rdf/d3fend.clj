This can help to prevent a certificate from being misused.\n\n### Certificate revocation status analysis\nUsing either Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to determine the revocation status. OCSP Stapling, binding the status with the certificate, helps to mitigate potential delay in status verifications.\n\n## Considerations\n* Management of the PKI across the enterprise typically requires automation to maintain scalability and flexibility\n* If the certificate authority, issuing the certificate, is compromised then all of the certificates issued by the CA are suspect\n* There may be delays associated with updates to certificates\n* Revoked certificates give the appearance of valid certificates until they are published to a trusted revocation service (OCSP or CRL)\n* The revocation service (OCSP or CRL) may be down during our connection and a browser will need to make a decision will need to be made about trusting the connection",

The information may be polled by network management softare or configured once and then pushed from network sensors (or agents.)\n\nAnother means of establishing network connectivity is by means of sendingn traffic through the use of a tool such as traceroute, to determine the logical paths through the network architecture.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* Best practice is to encrypte network monitoring data and require authentication for queries or admin/management functions.\n* Push notifications reduce bandwidth necessary to capture and maintain information if reliable transport is used.\n* Special consideration should be made before using of active scanning in OT networks and OT-safe options chosen where available.",

   "## How it works\nAuthentication event data is collected (logon information such as device id, time of day, day of week, geo-location, etc.) to create an activity baseline. Then, a threshold is determined either through a manually specified configuration, or a statistical analysis of deviations in historical data. New authentication events are evaluated to determine if a threshold is exceeded. Thresholds can be static or dynamic.\n\n### Actions\nAs a result of the analysis, actions taken could include:\n\n* [Account Locking](/technique/d3f:AccountLocking)\n* Raising an alert\n\n### Example data sources\n * Directory server logs\n * VPN Server logs\n * IDAM Capability logs\n * NAC logs\n * Authentication client logs\n * Kerberos network traffic\n * LDAP network traffic\n\n## Considerations\n\nThis technique covers statistical outliers. Though depending on the complexity or dimensionality of the data considered, outliers may not be obvious to a human analyst reviewing events in simplistic analytic views. If the malicious activity is not statistically different from benign activity, an alert threshold will not be met.",

   "Analyzing sequences of bytes and determining if they likely represent malicious shellcode.",
   :d3fend/kb-article
   "## How it works\n\nBytes are analyzed as if they are machine code instructions, and such instructions that are a common component of known shellcode are noted, such as stack pivots, reads from a Memory Address Table, and system calls for functions that disable protections or execute code.  For example, the x86 instruction `b0 0b: mov $11, %ax`, with no further alterations to the `%ax` register, followed by `cd 80: syscall` executes the system call `execve()` in the Linux kernel, which replaces the current process with another one specified -- this is a common action in shellcode, so this sequence would be flagged.\n\nThis technique detects shellcode despite whether or not it would cause a buffer overflow in the target binary.\n\nIf the sequence of bytes contains a sequence similar to that used in malicious shellcode, the entire byte sequence is flagged and a follow-on technique may be invoked.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### False Negatives\nIf the shellcode instructions are far apart, simple implementations might not detect the shellcode.\n\nDue to the nature of assembly instructions not having a defined start or end, implementations which do not process all start sequences (for example, when they a find byte sequence of interest, continue scanning forwards from the end of it) might not detect the shellcode.\n\nThis technique might not detect more complex or obfuscated instructions.  For that purpose, Dynamic Analysis or Emulated File Analysis could assist by analyzing the actual instruction function.\n\nThis technique may not detect self-modifying code.  To make it harder for a process to modify itself, Process Segment Execution Prevention should be used, while noting its considerations.\n\nThis technique might not detect malicious shellcode which reuses instructions in the target binary for malicious effect, as memory references in the presumed assembly code are not dereferenced.  Dynamic Analysis and Emulated File Analysis, when set up properly to fork from the running target binary, might detect this.  Process Segment Execution Prevention combined with Segment Address Offset Randomization frequently makes introduction of shellcode through overwriting a saved return pointer more difficult.  Call stack depth analysis might detect excessive reuse of instructions in the target binary.  Shadow Stack Frames might detect that a stack frame's return address has changed and Stack Frame Canary Verification might detect that the stack frame's return address was overwritten.  Other heuristic methods might detect jump-oriented programming shellcode.\n\nWith inserting code directly, that it is not a buffer overflow, and just some place where code is executed either to a file or a write-what-where, the buffer overflow mitigations do not help.  Behavioral analysis could detect this, or proper access control could mitigate this.\n\n### False Positives\n\nByte sequences containing code that is never used as machine code are still analyzed and flagged for anomalies, and [eventually](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55871.html), it is likely that an attack sequence will arise from the sheer volume of bytes transmitted.",

Certificate authorities, revocation lists, and third-party secure logs are used in the analysis. Analysis includes detection of server impersonation, phishing domains, and forged certificates.\n\nTLS certificates are designed to expire to ensure that the cryptographic keys are forced to be changed on a regular basis. The certificates in the trust path also expire and can cause a break in the trust chain. This means that even if a server certificate is updated correctly, intermediate certificates can expire and the trust chain is not maintained. This can cause services to become unavailable.",

   "## How it works\nPinning allows for a trusted copy of a certificate or public key to be associated with a server and thus reducing the likelihood of frequently visited sites being subjected to man-in-the-middle attacks. Certificates or public keys can be pinned after a trusted connection has been established or the pinning can be preloaded in an application, which is the preferred method for mobile applications.\n\nPinning can take the form of certificate pinning or public key pinning.\n\n## Forms of Pinning\n* Certificate Pinning\nCertificate Pinning (CP) allows for the client to verify the X509 certificate with a preloaded certificate. Typically, this is involves storing a hash of the certificate and using the stored hash for comparison to the hash of the certificate submitted during the SSL handshake.\n\n* Public Key Pinning\nPublic Key Pinning (PKP) requires the extraction of a public key from server's certificate. The stored public key is compared to the server's presented public key. A public key is expected to rotate less frequently than an X509 certificate and is generally favored over certificate pinning.\n\nAn extension of PKP is Subject Public Key Information Pinning (SPKI) includes public key pinning plus additional information for SSL connections. The additional information can include preferred algorithms.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* With pinned certificates whenever a server updates its certificate, the pinned certificates will also need to be updated\n* With pinned public keys the extracted key may be subject to key refresh policies but much less frequently\n* Servers can become unavailable if pinned objects are set and not updated with the rotated identities. This may require a pinning strategy to be developed.\n* The application of this technique within web browser applications has been [deprecated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public_Key_Pinning) by  popular web browser developers. They now favor certificate analysis via public certificate transparency logs, and the EXPECT-CT HTTP header.",

First, network traffic is captured to map out the network to identify network assets as well as unallocated IP space. The map is then used to determine if connection attempts are being made to the unallocated IP space.\n\n### Monitoring for sequentially transmitted traffic\nAnother approach passively inspects network traffic with application protocol analyzers observing network activity characteristics such as volume of packets sent/ received, TCP session attributes, and connection information between hosts (start time, source/destination host, services, etc.). Then using pattern matching to identify traffic which appears to be probing for network hosts.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* Implementations that rely on analysis of unallocated IP address space increase in their complexity with network size and decentralized network infrastructure.\n* Inventory of unallocated IP space should should be continuously updated to mitigate the risk of false positives.\n* IPv6 also introduces challenges including IPv6 traffic bypassing IPv4 specific protection systems (ex. firewalls and IDS) and complexity in managing both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.",

   "## How it works\n\n#### Memory\nCredentials may be stored in memory for a variety of reasons; on Windows, they may be stored in lsass.exe.  Once a credential dumper like mimikatz runs and dumps the memory of lsass.exe, the credentials of every account logged on since boot are potentially compromised.\nWhen such an event occurs, this analytic will give the forensic context to identify compromised users. Those users could potentially be used in later events for additional logons.\n\n\n#### Hard disk\nOperating System may cache a certain number of credentials onto the hard disk to use as a source of truth if it cannot contact the credential server.  In many versions of Microsoft Windows, the 10 most recent are cached by default; this setting can be changed in the Microsoft Management Console's Local Security Policy: ```Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Local Policy -> Security Options -> Interactive Logon: Number of previous logons to cache -> 0```  Here we are not concerned with the alteration of the credentials but the fact that they might be read.  If the attacker has physical access to the machine they are unlikely to be stopped from reading files on the filesystem.\n\"In the event that the domain controller is unavailable Windows will check the last password hashes that has been cached in order to authenticate the user with the system. These password hashes are cached in the following registry setting:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SECURITY\\Cache\nMimikatz can retrieve these hashes if the following command is executed:\nlsadump::cache\" [1]\n\nThe Registry Hive, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SAM, which is stored in the supporting files %systemroot%\\System32\\Config\\{Sam,sam.log,sam.sav}, contains the SAM file.\n\nDC: This is stored in %systemroot%\\ntds\\ntds.dit. (https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/blog/default.aspx?d=10/2017)\n\nSometimes memory, which contains credentials, could get on the hard disk. Like with hiberfil.sys in Windows.  Equivalent on Linux\n\n\nIn Linux, an attacker could read the /etc/shadow file.\n\nReading from /proc directory: mimipenguin, many others.\n\n## Considerations\nEffective implementation requires identifying any location that could end up containing credentials, and detecting an method of potential access to a source of credential data.\n\n1. https://medium.com/blue-team/preventing-mimikatz-attacks-ed283e7ebdd5",

These factors are used to develop a score and if that score is over a certain threshold, an alert is generated.\n* Collected malware samples can be executed in a virtual environment to identify network domains that are connected to during execution. The network domains are then generated into signatures to identity bad domains for other hosts.\n\nThis technique does not check for content hosted at the domain.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* DNS produces a large amount of traffic which can be resource-intensive to analyze in real time.\n* If a server is compromised, for example, as part of a watering hole attack, but the DNS information pointing to that server is not altered, this technique would not catch such an incident.",

A dependent DLL associated with the driver is configured to be processed before other dependent DLLs and executes a number of operations to ensure the driver associated with the security agent is initialized first.\n\n* Kernel components can be signed by a certificate obtained by a third party to verify the source of the component and whether it has been modified. When signed, the component will include a signature block implemented as a hash value of the component header and can also include a certificate chain. The signature and certificate data are typically added before the kernel component is distributed to the public.\n\n\n## Considerations\n\n* The private keys to sign certificates as reputable companies have been stolen in the past -- in cases such as where certificates from Adobe, Realtek, and JMicron have been used to sign malicious executables. (Source: https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/cybercrime-exploits-digital-certificates/#gref)\n\n* Trusted Root Certificate Authorities have been compromised, yielding the ability to use the compromised keys to generate certificates with an arbitrary company name.\n\n* It may not be difficult for an attacker to start an organization which can obtain a signed certificate.\n\n* A root certificate authority (CA) whose certificate is trusted in the verification logic could generate incorrect certificates, if they are lax or have ulterior motives.",

   "## How It Works\nWhen a process encounters an exception, it calls an exception handler to deal with the exception.  The method by which this exception handler is determined varies by the operating system.  The exception handler is called, even if it is the default exception handler to terminate the program and display a message that the program stopped working.  In the case that no valid exception handler is found, the program would fail to proceed as normal and could be programmed to terminate.\n\nIn Windows, the address of the exception registration record is stored at the very start of the the Thread Information Block; the GS register points to this structure.\n\nThe exception registration record contains two pointers: a pointer to the next exception registration record should this handler fail to handle the exception, and a pointer to the handler.\n\nA buffer overflow can overwrite the saved return pointer with an invalid location to execute memory; this often triggers the exception handler chain, which could also be corrupted by the buffer overflow.  Although Process Exception Handler Validation does not make sure that the exception handler pointer or the code at the exception handler was unaltered, or that the exception handler code is secure, this technique does ensure that the pointer is at least an exception handler that could be called by the program.\n\nWith Process Exception Handler Validation, before the handler is called, it checks the exception handler against a source of valid exception handlers.  If the requested handler is not in this list, other techniques such as those in Process Eviction might be invoked, such as Process Termination to end the current process, or Executable Blacklisting to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.\n\n### Runtime valid exception handler source generation\nThe source of valid exception handlers could be generated at runtime, with the risk of the information that is used to determine the validity of exception handlers being compromised.\n\n### Compile-time\nThe source of valid exception handlers could also be generated at compile time or as a binary patch.  Given the source code, it would be rather straightforward to find the exceptions, as they are pointed in the catch statement of a try-catch clause and the compiler must already generate the code to call exceptions from this.\n\n## Considerations\nIf the program file can be altered by the attacker, then the security could be bypassed by replacing it with any desired program, without even bypassing SEH.\n\nIf the attacker was already able to overwrite the code for a valid exception handler via other functionality in the program, this defense would not prevent arbitrary code execution.\nIf an exception handler recognized as valid is vulnerable, it would be executed anyway.\n\nSafeSEH might be applied only to some executable files or modules, allowing an attacker to call any piece of code as an exception handler in the unprotected modules.",

For example reassembly may be done in real-time or streaming fashion, or packets may be written to disk, then bulk processed.  The packets may arrive out of order, with fragmentation, duplicates, or re-transmissions.

   "## How it works\nRules, often called signatures, are used for both generic and targeted malware detection. The rules are usually expressed in a domain specific language (DSL), then deployed to software that scans files for matches. The rules are developed and broadly distributed by commercial vendors, or they are developed and deployed by enterprise security teams to address highly targeted or custom malware. Conceptually, there are public and private rule sets. Both leverage the same technology, but they are intended to detect different types of cyber adversaries.\n\n## Considerations\n* Patterns expressed in the DSLs range in their complexity. Some scanning engines support file parsing and normalization for high fidelity matching, others support only simple regular expression matching against raw file data. Engineers must make a trade-off in terms of:\n     * The fidelity of the matching capabilities in order to balance high recall with avoiding false positives,\n     * The computational load for scanning, and\n     * The resilience of the engine to deal with adversarial content presented in different forms-- content which in some cases is designed to exploit or defeat the scanning engines.\n * Signature libraries can become large over time and impact scanning performance.\n * Some vendors who sell signatures have to delete old signatures over time.\n * Simple signatures against raw content cannot match against encoded, encrypted, or sufficiently obfuscated content.\n\n## Implementations\n * YARA\n * ClamAV",

Asymmetric encryption is typically slower than symmetric encryption and not widely used for large file encryption, but is popular for key wrapping, key exchanges, and digital signatures.\n\n## Considerations\n- Continuous monitoring to ensure private keys are not compromised and the certificate authority (CA) is trusted.\n- Secure transfer of private keys between multiple devices.",

Memory pages are scanned and if a modification is detected the software component may lock the page. This will protect subsequent attempted modifications to the firmware.

The injected software will monitor and alert, in near real-time, on potential suspicious activity. The injected code is run alongside of the embedded code in the host. The injected software operates as an independent entity and is not dependent on the host software.\n\nFinally, this technique may implement other countermeasure techniques as part of their analytical processes.

   "## How it works\n\nThis technique prevents a client from learning IP addresses deemed to be potentially malicious, which would have been delivered via forward resolution responses.\n\nResponses to forward resolution requests (that is, requests where a domain is sent and IP(s) are returned) are collected, and the IP address(es) included as a response are examined. If the IP address(es) are in a range included in the blacklist, then the response is dropped and not forwarded to the client.\n\nThe DNS lookup can be blocked by either dropping the network traffic with an inline device, or modifying the value of the response sent by the DNS server. To transparently prevent client applications from hanging on a request, it is common practice to replace malicious values with addresses in the range 127.0.0.0/8 or the address of a honeypot maintained by the network administrators.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* This technique does not prevent the client from contacting the blacklisted IP, only from learning about this IP address via a nameserver lookup request.\n* DNS Response traffic can be transmitted over many different protocols, which presents a challenge to implementing methods to extract all DNS answer IP address value(s).\n  * DNS has historically used UDP port 53, with TCP port 53 instead used for responses over 512 bytes or after a lack of response over UDP.\n  * Usage of new protocols to provide confidentiality for DNS traffic, such as DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLS), complicates collection of the IP address(es) in DNS responses. These protocols have often been enabled in browser settings transparently after a browser update, with DNS requests proxied over one of these cryptographic protocols through a specified host.\n* This technique must be implemented logically between the application that receives the response and the server which sent the response.\n  * DNS responses sent in an encrypted manner, such as those using DoH or DoT, will require interception of the TLS connections in order to determine the IP address(es) in the response.\n* Replacing the response is not effective in the case that the nameserver uses a technique to provide integrity of its responses, such as DNSSEC for DNS responses.",

   "## How it works\nProcess isolation, in this context, is address space separation controlled by a security function that limits the communication between processes so that one process cannot directly modify the executing code of another process. For example with virtual address space:\n\n* Process A address space is different from process B address space, which prevents process A from writing to process B\n\nHardware process isolation is commonly implemented through Direct Memory Access (DMA) which collaborates with a Memory Management Unit (MMU), or Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU). These hardware controls are deployed directly on processors to aid hosts or enclaves in process isolation.\n\n* DMA - Direct memory access allows memory access to occur independently of the program currently run by the microprocessor. DMA allows for I/O devices to directly read from and write to memory, or it can be used to efficiently copy blocks of memory. During DMA transfers, the microprocessor can execute an unrelated program.\n* MMU - A memory management unit acts as an access control and is responsible for performing the translation of virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses. The MMU allocates each process its own virtual memory space.\n* IOMMU - An input-output memory management unit is used to allocate each I/O device its own virtual address space to the underlying physical addresses. IOMMU allows devices that do not support long memory addresses to address the entire memory space.\n\n## Considerations\n* Private hosts may be vulnerable to DMA attack if they have a PCI or PCI Express port that connects attached devices directly to physical address space.\n\n## Implementations:\n * Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (Intel VT-d)\n * Firecracker",

The blacklisted named components are typically crafted modifications of known good domains, e.g., gooogle.com versus google.com. The blacklisted domains typically resemble trusted domains, but have been altered slightly to deceive users.\n\nThe blacklisted named components also include consideration for fonts or Unicode characters that can make certain characters appear very similar (zero vs capital O and the letter l vs the number one). The blacklisted domains under certain fonts will appear to be a trusted domain.\n\n## Considerations\n* Maintaining the currency of the list can be a challenge especially with newly registered domain entries.\n* Blacklists should have identified maintenance cycles to ensure lists are not stale.",

The agent software is configurable to limit the use of certain devices connected to IO ports. The restriction software can also be configured to limit the access to files and applications on external storage devices connected to IO ports.\n\nHardware-based restriction can also be employed to limit access to IO ports. For example, a hardware USB filter device that is placed between the host system and the external devices can filter IO port connections based on configurable rules. When new devices are connected to the USB filter the type of device is determined. Using an allow list a connection determination is made for the device.\n\nSome implementations detect when a device is connected in order to authorize the connection against a list of approved devices, in some cases by device type. For example, if the device is determined to be a storage device, then the contained files and executables are examined to more accurately identify the device type.\n\nTypes of restrictions that may be applied:\n- Device connection\n- Device command filtering\n- Device file system read or write restrictions\n\n## Considerations\n * Agent software will need to be installed on host systems\n * Configurations for allow/deny for devices and files will need to be maintained",

   "## How it works\n\nThis technique is used to detect an attacker attempting to exploit and execute code on a target system's call stack using return-oriented programming (ROP). Modern processors that have the ability to maintain a list of the branching calls, e.g., Intel's Last Branch Recording (LBR), can be used to track and analyze indirect branching calls that are indicative of malicious activity.\n\nIn order to reduce the number of indirect branch calls to analyze to a manageable set it is assumed that malicious ROP activity will involve the use of system calls.  The technique observes indirect branch calls that are part of paths that lead to system calls, all others are ignored. Branching calls chained together is often referred to as gadgets and gadgets are often used in ROP attacks. Indirect branch calls that involve a transfer from user-space to kernel-space are of interest for this technique.\n\nIdentification of potential ROP exploit execution includes:\n\n- Inspecting the LBR when a system function call is made\n\n  - The LBR is configured to return only instruction of interest (ret, indirect jmp, indirect calls)\n\n\n- Behavior is analyzed for\n  - Ret instructions that appear to target areas not preceded by the call sites\n  - Sequences of small code fragments that appear to be chained through the indirect branching calls (gadgets)\n\n\n- Of interest are returns that appear to not render control back after calls\n  - Typical ret-call are paired\n  - gadgets will appear to have ret followed by instruction of next instruction of the following gadget\n\n\n## Considerations\n\n* May be operating system dependent since specific system calls are used to scope branching behavoir\n* Processors need to support access to a Last Branch Recording list feature\n* The size of the LBR stack can limit the expected size of the analyzed execution stack\n* If processor does not support LBR then overhead costs for the analysis can be significant",

This does not match the normal cadence of input, and the device is disabled.\n\nInput to type the session user's name takes abnormally longer for each keystroke.  The system is locked to the password prompt screen.\n\nA system receives key press events from two different devices -- one device sends keystrokes after the other has been idle for a long time.\n\nA system receives physical input in a user session, while that user has sent input from a device located out of the country in the past hour.\n\nNetwork traffic is suddenly routed through a new external device, and nearly the same volume of network traffic is subsequently sent out the previously existing interface.  The new external device is disabled, and an alert is raised to investigate the network configuration for a potential compromise.\n\n\n## Considerations\n\nGiven some example of legitimate behavioral input patterns, attackers could mimic those input patterns, a technique which has been used in popular culture in the creation of Deepfake videos and [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com).",

Its name comes from lap, as it was deemed to be placed on a person's lap when being used. Although originally there was a distinction between laptops and notebooks (the former being bigger and heavier than the latter), as of 2014, there is often no longer any difference. Today, laptops are commonly used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for playing games, web browsing",

   "## How it works\nMandatory access control is a non-discretionary access control system because the rules and polices that determine access is determined by a security control authority and not distributed to local users. Access determinations are based on designed access control polices and are not based on local resource owner determinations.\n\nAccess is typically granted by defining sets of subjects and sets of objects. Subjects are the entities requesting access and objects are the resources that subjects are trying to access. Rules and policies are defined that associate subjects and object permissions and access controls.\n\n### Common MAC implementations\n#### Security label access control\nA fine-grained form of mandatory access control is to apply security labels to individual resources, including processes, and the access control decisions are against a particular resource and a given user attempting to gain access. This type of MAC requires that the file system has built-in support for security labels.\n\nAccess controls are typically implemented through the use of label identifiers for every file system object. Identifier labels are applied to resources and users are assigned a similar access identifier. Users attempting to access a resource will result in the operating system performing an access control check. The access control check will compare the assigned user's credentials to that of the resource or object they are attempting to access.\n\nA security context is associated with resources and is used to determine assess. Typical basic access control elements include users, roles and types and together they form a security context which is the basis for the security labels.\n\nThis type of access control is what is employed in SELinux [2]. This form of MAC is considered the most flexible implementation, but it also is the most complex to deploy across the enterprise. Where multiple virtual machines (VM) are run together this type of access control is typically employed to ensure true isolation of processes and VMs.\n\n#### File path level controls\nA less fine-grained form of mandatory access control is to apply security labels that allow for access control at the file path level.  Access control is filesystem agnostic and no relabeling of resources is required. Pathname access control usually seems more natural for implementation and corresponding access audits.\n\nThis type of MAC is what is employed in AppArmor [3]. AppArmor was developed to provide a simpler alternative MAC method with much less management overhead. A simple access policy is maintained that defines path resource access rules. Access control attributes are typically associated with programs instead of users.\n\n\n## Considerations\nSome implementations of security label mandatory access control contain complex rules set that are hard to verify and complex to maintain over time.\n\nInitial planning of access model and continuous monitoring of the available users, resources and object is necessary.\n\n## Implementations\n\n * Linux C-Groups, and policy engines like SELinux and AppArmor\n * Windows Mandatory Integrity Control introduced in Windows Vista\n\n\n### Citations\n1.

   "## Technique Overview\n\nEmail and messaging are frequently used to deliver malicious content to targets. These enterprise capabilities are used to deliver software exploits or social engineering tricks. If the recipient of a message trusts the sender, attackers can avoid escalating suspicion.\n\nEmails and messages are also complex data structures. They contain files and links, and complex data encodings which vary region to region. Thus the defensive techniques used to analyze emails and messages are highly varied ranging from deep content analysis and execution to social network graph-style analytics to analyze trust or risk.",

   "## How it works\n\n### Digital Signature\nDigital signatures are used to verifying a message is from the expected sender. In email, Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocol is typically used to digitally sign messages. A hash value of the sender's message is created and encrypted with the sender's private key to create a digital signature. The message and the digital signature are sent to the recipient where the sender's public key is used to decrypt the digital signature and compute the hash of the message. The computed hash is compared with the hash from the received message, and any difference in the hash values signify the message did not originate from the sender and has been alerted in transit.\n\n### Message Authentication Code (MAC)\nMAC is a fixed size string that is appended to a message to provide message authentication and integrity. The sender MAC signing algorithm takes as input a secret symmetric key shared between sender and recipient and the message to calculate a short tag that is appended to the message. The recipient receives the message with the appended tag, and a MAC verification algorithm is run using the symmetric key to verify the message came from the stated sender and ensure the message has not been tampered with.\n\n## Considerations\n- Public keys associated with digital signatures should be verified by a Certification Authority (CA) to prevent impersonation. The CA verifies the owner of a public key and puts the sender's identity and public key into a certificate that is signed by the CA.\n- Digital signatures provide non-repudiation where a third party can verify the authenticity of the message using the sender's digital certificate signed by the CA.\n- Symmetric keys must be exchanged securely via a private channel and management of new symmetric keys are needed for each pair of participants wishing to exchange messages.",

The sender encrypts messages using the recipient's public key and the receipt decrypts the message using their private key. Standards that can be used to implement message encryption include S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) and PGP.\n### Symmetric Cryptography\nSymmetric encryption uses the same cryptographic key by both the sender and receiver to encrypt and decrypt a message. Asymmetric key exchange protocols such as Diffie-Hellman can be used to share the cryptographic key with the recipient.\n\n## Considerations\n- Separate configuration settings to enable message encryption are often needed for each messenger client (e.g. webmail, desktop client, mobile).\n- Continuous monitoring to ensure private keys are not compromised and the certificate authority (CA) is trusted.\n- Secure transfer of private keys between multiple devices.",

The one-time password may be from a list provided in advance, sent via a channel such as SMS or HTTPS to an app, or a generated token.\n\nIn the case of a physical token which generates one-time passwords incrementally based on time elapsed, that token device need not be connected to the internet. In different implementations, an administrator of the system, or a user with additional verification, can adjust for clock skew between the token and the verification system as needed.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Compromise of delivery channel\n- SIM Swapping\n- Secure token visual compromise\n- Insecure delivery channel\n\n### Compromise of delivery device\nPhysical loss of One-time Password device.\n\n### Compromise of long-term backup codes\nThese are often provided in the form of a downloadable document with a regular name, which can be searched for in the case that the user forgets where they put them.  This digital file or printed document could be stolen.\nAdditionally, after the code file is printed, it could be recovered from the system printer spool unless the spooler cache is cleared.",

Firewalls are deployed either directly on hosts through kernel level software implementations or installed in-line directly on network links. There are benefits and disadvantages to each approach.\n\nThere are various strategies for developing filtering rulesets:\n\n* Block everything by default\n* Limit destination hosts\n* Limit destination transport or application protocols\n* Restrict content outbound (Ex. strings formatted as social security numbers, or proprietary data)\n\n## Considerations\n* Dynamic IP assignment creates challenges for Outbound Traffic Filtering because users are not necessarily associated with the same IP address. This can be addressed by linking IP address management information with the filtering logic.\n* Connections using non-standard transport layer ports may circumvent outbound traffic filtering technology which does not detect application protocol based on traffic content.\n* Business requirements typically drive the development of filtering rule sets.\n\n## Implementations\n- iptables (Linux)\n- Windows Firewall\n- pf (BSD)",

   "## How it works\nCertificates are analyzed outside of a TLS server connection using third-party secure update logs, domain name analysis and analytics.\n\n### Secure update certificate logs\n* Certificate Logs\nThe key enabling feature is a secure service that maintains record logs of certificate activities. The logs allow users to only append certificates and never to delete or modify the log entries. The logs use Merkle Tree Hashes to ensure they have not been tampered with. The logging service also allows for public auditing by any user.\n\nThe logging service, upon receipt of a certificate to log, will respond with a signed certificate timestamp (SCT). The SCT guarantees the certificate will be added to the log within the time specified. The SCT must be present with the certificate during a TLS handshake.\n\n* Certificate Monitoring\nCertificate monitoring, of the logs, is typically done by the CA and they watch for suspicious certificate logging and unusual certificates or extensions or permissions. Monitors are also responsible for verifying the logs are accurate and public.\n\n* Certificate Auditors\nLog integrity is verified by log auditors. Auditors make use of log proofs are used to validate the cryptographic hashes (Merkle Trees) that the log employs are consistent. In order to ensure consistency throughout multiple monitors and auditors, sharing a common logging service, gossip protocol is employed.\n\n### Phishing domain name analysis\n* A curated corpus of known benign domains and phishing domain names is used as training text for machine learning. Through the use of feature set extraction, vectors labels are created with scoring to indicated if they are considered benign or phishing domains.\n\n* A stream of new or updated SSL certificates with fully qualified domain names (FQDN) is analyzed against the feature vectors and a predictive model determines a score for the domains. The scoring considers distance measures such as Levenshtein distance to help in determining the final label score. Supervised learning is also employed using the curated domains of benign and phishing domains.\n\n* Subdomain phishing analysis, prepending a trusted domain to a phishing domain, and regular expression comparisons  are also used in the label scoring model. A tunable measure is used to determine the threshold for alerting. This measure helps to balance between precision and recall measures.\n\n## Considerations\n* Some entity will need to run the logging service and a trusted entity is preferred.\n* Certificate Authorities will likely need to monitor the logging service for consistency.\n* Certificate revocation is unchanged and remains outside of Certificate Transparency, but certificates needing to be revoked are visible.\n* Technique dependent of reliable feed of new and updated certificates\n* Some certificate authorities allow for certificates to be registered with wildcards in the FQDN and thus will fail some of the subdomain scoring\n* Phishing HTTP domains will not be discovered",

   "## How It Works\n\nPointer Authentication (frequently referred to as PAC, although the technique is properly Pointer Authentication) is a security feature to provide protection against attackers with memory read/write access.  A Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) is a cryptographic hash or derivative computed on the value of a pointer and some additional context information which can then provide a cryptographically strong guarantee about the likelihood that a pointer has been tampered with by an attacker.\n\nAlthough pointers are 64 bits, most systems have a substantially smaller virtual address space, leaving unused bits in pointers that can store the value of the PAC, this can be done to reduce memory space requirements. One implementation is in ARMv8.3-A.  A PAC is computed over the 64-bit pointer value and a 64-bit context value.  Instructions are introduced to deal with pointers: one category to compute and insert the PAC into a pointer, another category to verify the pointer and invalidate the pointer if the PAC does not check, and a third category to remove the pointer and restore the original value without verifying.\n\nThe ARM standard specifies a cryptographic algorithm called QARMA-64 (designed by Qualcomm) to compute the signature, although this algorithm is not required.  The architecture provides for five secret 128-bit Pointer Authentication keys: two for instruction pointers, two for data pointers, and a general key for signing larger blocks of data.\n\n## Considerations\n\nIn the ARM implementation, the mechanisms above for manipulating PACS are provided, but it is up to the code developer to manage the keys for the cryptographic algorithm.\n\n\nA known potential limitation of PACs concerns signing gadgets. Under certain circumstances PACs can be bypassed by forcing the system to run a signing gadget which will allow the signing of arbitrary pointers to occur.",

   "## How it works\n\nDuring execution of a process, the instruction pointer register should only point to addresses in a code segment (also called the .text segment), as this is the sole segment which should contain program code.\n\nWhen this technique detects an attempt to execute something that has been designated as non-executable, other techniques such as those in **Process Eviction** might be invoked, such as **Process Termination** to end the current process, or **Executable Blacklisting** to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.\n\n### Software-based implementations\nThe software-based implementation in Windows XP SP2 might not check that every time the instruction pointer is changed, and does not check on each jump or return.  Before calling an exception handler, Windows XP SP2 software-enforced DEP checks whether the exception handler is located in a memory region marked as executable.  If the program was also built with SafeSEH, this implementation also checks before changing control to the exception handler whether it is a registered exception handler in the program's file on disk.\n\n### Hardware-based implementations\nThe NX (No Execute) or XD (Execute Disable) bit on the processor specifies whether a certain part of memory is executable.  Early implementations set this bit by the memory segment, while modern implementations which are built on the flat memory model often store this bit in each entry of the page table, to control execution by the page.\n\n\n## Considerations\n\nNon-hardware process data segment execution prevention is more susceptible to being able to be turned off for a page of memory.\n\nDifferent implementations of this defense have been in place since the 1980s, but implementation stalled when larger 16-bit programs began stuffing code in the segments usually reserved for data. Many modern programs follow the best practice of separation of code and data, are able to run under this defense.\n\nROP or ret2libc/return-to-function attacks could bypass this defense, as although they may pass attacker-controlled data or stack frames to a function, they abuse functions that are legitimately located in the .text segment (code segment) of the program.  For those, more advanced defenses such as a table of valid jump addresses, function call analysis, or return depth analysis could be used.",

   :d3fend/kb-article
   "## How it works\n\nProcesses are managed by the operating system kernel.  Different operating system kernels manage the creation and termination of processes in a different manner, and expose this functionality via the kernel API.\n\nA running process might be terminated to mitigate its immediate effects if it is exhibiting anomalous, unauthorized, or malicious behavior; such as after detecting anomalous behavior via <a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:AdministrativeNetworkActivityAnalysis\" rdf:about=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#AdministrativeNetworkActivityAnalysis\">Administrative Network Activity Analysis</a>, after a failed check from <a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:StackFrameCanaryVerification\" rdf:about=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#StackFrameCanaryValidation\">Stack Frame Canary Validation</a>, or after <a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SystemCallAnalysis\" rdf:about=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#SystemCallAnalysis\">System Call Analysis</a> finds an attempt to execute an unauthorized system call.\n\n### Proprietary technology\nSecurity software might use proprietary technology to terminate processes, instead of the system-provided functions.    Further research may provide specific detail on such methods used.\n\n### System-provided functions\n\n#### Windows tools\nIn Windows, `ExitProcess()` is used to send a signal to a process to request it to exit, and `TerminateProcess()` is used to force a process to exit.\n\nThe `taskkill` executable available in the cmd shell is used to kill a process, with the `/F` switch forcing termination as with `TerminateProcess()`.  In PowerShell, `Stop-Process` is used, which is aliased by default to `spps` and `kill`.  Processes started in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment may be terminated there with the `kill` command.\n\n#### Unix/Linux tools\nIn Unix-like systems, all process termination requests are handled using signals.  The `kill` function takes the Process ID and signal to send, and is accessible with the `kill` command.  Some shells have a `kill` builtin function which is separate than the `kill` binary, which can also kill background jobs in the shell and additionally perform the function faster, and can run from an existing instance of the shell if the process table is full.  The signal SIGTERM specifies that the process to terminate may invoke a handler that it has defined instead of terminating, and the signal SIGKILL forces immediate termination.\n\nThe related command `xkill` terminates the connection of a program to the X window server, after which the user process may decide to terminate itself; however, termination is not guaranteed as the process, which could be on the same or different host, could then run in a terminal or reconnect to a different X server on any host.  Emacs is such a program that would not terminate itself after its connection to the X server is terminated.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Persistence Mechanisms\nTerminating a malicious process is not enough to stop an adversary that has already gained persistence in the host via any initial access mechanism, including through that process or another access mechanism.\n\n### Terminating Multiple Processes\nOn most operating systems, process termination operations typically occur independently of each other, without functionality provided to atomically terminate multiple processes.  If there are multiple malicious processes which can make system calls to spawn other processes once one of them is closed, user session termination or system restart might be required.\n\n### Process Access Permissions\nUsers must have permissions to kill the process.  On Unix-like systems, either root or the process user can kill the process.  On Windows systems, process permissions are managed separately via process security tokens.\n\n### Process Resource Handles\n\n#### Terminating Processes with Open Resource Handles\n\nProcesses may have open resource handles, which could leave those resources in an undesired state if the process is forced to terminate.  As such, most operating systems provide a means to send a signal to a process to inform it to gracefully terminate, and on most of these operating systems, it is the typical first step used to terminate a process.\n\n#### Signal Traps\nAs the process may have open resource handles, commonly-used methods of process termination involve sending a signal to the process to terminate.\nOn Windows, the `ExitProcess()` function is used for this purpose.  Process instructions, as well as a third-party DLL can also cause the process to exit.\nOn Linux, the process is sent a signal on the occurrence of various events: when it loses the console, `SIGHUP`; when termination is requested, `SIGTERM`.  The processor then redirects execution to the function registered to handle the signal.\n\nTherefore, sending a signal to the process to ask it to terminate may not always work.\n\n##### Avoiding Signal Traps\n\nOn Unix-like systems, sending the `SIGKILL` signal for a process does not send a message to the process or invoke an implementation-defined handler; instead, it immediately does not allow the process to execute any further processor instructions.   On Windows `TerminateProcess()` instead of `ExitProcess()` performs the equivalent.\n\n#### Hang on System Call Execution\n\nEven still, as the operating system kernel manages the processes, kernel code may block process signals, including those which cannot be trapped, and does in certain circumstances.  Signals are blocked and queued for the duration of the system call when interrupting the system call would result in a kernel invariant being violated, such as when an action results in a malformed data structure; this blocking is common for filesystem requests.  Such system calls can hang when a filesystem has gone offline, leading to a long-term uninterruptible sleep, represented in POSIX command `ps` output as D state.\nAny malicious system calls or system call handlers are issues of a much larger problem (a kernel-level rootkit) and the system should be redeployed entirely or restored from a backup known to be prior to compromise, and other systems accessible directly and indirectly from that one should also be examined.\n\nA process that is truly hung in a system call may prevent the system from shutting down and leave it in an unresponsive state; a hard power off is required.\n\nTo speed up the action of terminating a process in uninterruptible sleep, the process resource accesses (handles) could be analyzed.\n\nOn Linux, [`sync` followed by `echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt) is a safe way to free up some inactive resource handles.\n\n\n#### Kernel Processes and Threads\nThe kernel may not allow kernel processes, which are created via methods other than user-space processes, to be terminated.\n\n#### Other Code using the Process\n\nTerminating a shared library can lead to unexpected errors; such shared libraries have their own mechanisms for termination.\n\nOn Windows, a DLL is unloaded when the reference count of the library reaches 0.\n\n#### Zombie process\n\nAfter a process has been terminated, it may still take up an entry in the operating system process table until another event occurs.\n\n##### Windows\nIn Windows, a process object is deleted when the last handle to the process is closed.\n\n##### Linux\nIn Linux, a process is removed from the process table when it is reaped by its parent process.  If the parent terminates, historically the parent has been changed to pid 1; however, in the Linux kernel 3.4 and above, processes can set a different process as the subreaper using the `prctl()` system call.\n\nZombie processes and hung processes could be resolved with a restart of the system.\n\n#### System restart\nFinally a system restart might be required to kill a process.\nSystems which are only accessible via a remote in-band connection may become inaccessible if a process termination operation that is necessary for reboot does not complete.\n\n### Subsystems\nProcesses that are started in a subsystem might not be fully terminated if they are terminated using the command for that subsystem.  For example, in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), processes started and terminated via WSL calls such as with the `kill` command in Bash may still have an entry in the Windows process table.",

In one embodiment, a system implementing an active firewall is provided which includes methodology for verifying or authenticating communications between network components (e.g., sensor(s), arbiter, and actor(s)), using cryptographic keys or digital certificates. Certificates may be used to digitally sign a message or file and, in a complementary manner, to verify a digital signature. At the outset, particular software components that may participate in authenticated communication are specified, including creating a digital certificate for each such software component. Upon detection by a sensor that an event of interest that has occurred in the computer network system, the system may initiate authenticated communication between the sensor component and a central arbiter (e.g., \"event orchestrator\") component, so that the sensor may report the event to the arbiter or \"brain.\" Thereafter, the arbiter (if it chooses to act on that information) initiates authenticated communication between itself and a third software component, an \"actor\" component (e.g., \"firewall\"). The arbiter may indicate to the actor how it should handle the event. The actor or firewall, upon receiving the information, may now undertake appropriate action, such as dynamically creating or modifying rules for appropriately handling the event, or it may choose to simply ignore the information.",

   "The invention provides a system and method for automatic creation of adaptive behavioral profiles for observables associated with resource states and events in a computer network (IT) infrastructure of an enterprise and for detecting anomalies that represent potential malicious activity and threats as deviations from normal behavior. Separate profiles may be created for each behavioral indicator, as well as for each time series of measurements, and aggregated to create an overall behavioral profile. An anomaly probability is determined from the behavioral profile and used to evaluate the data values of observables. Outlier data values which deviate from normal behavior by more than a predetermined probability threshold are identified for risk analysis as possible threats while inliers within the range of normal behavior are used to update the behavioral profile. Behavioral profiles are created for behavioral indicators based upon observables measured over predetermined time periods using algorithms employing statistical analysis approaches that work for any type of data distribution, and profiles are adapted over time using data aging to more closely represent current behavior. Algorithm parameters for creating profiles are based on the type of data, i.e., its metadata.",

   "Microsoft Windows uses its implementation of Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Call (DCE/RPC), which it calls Microsoft RPC, to call certain APIs remotely.\n\nA Remote Procedure Call is initiated by communicating to the RPC Endpoint Mapper, which exists as the Windows service RpcEptMapper and listens on the port 135/tcp. The endpoint mapper resolves a requested endpoint/interface and responds to the client with the port that the service is listening on. Since the RPC endpoints are assigned ports when the services start, these ports are dynamically assigned from 49152 to 65535. The connection to the endpoint mapper then terminates and the client program can communicate directly with the requested service.\n\nRPC is a legitimate functionality of Windows that allows remote interaction with a variety of services. For a Windows environment to be properly configured, several programs use RPC to communicate legitimately with servers. The background and benign RPC activity may be enormous, but must be learned, especially peer-to-peer RPC between workstations, which is often indicative of Lateral Movement.",

   "As described in ATT&CK, an adversary can use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to view or manipulate objects on a remote host. It can be used to remotely edit configuration, start services, query files, and anything that can be done with a WMI class. When remote WMI requests are over RPC (CAR-2014-05-001), it connects to a DCOM interface within the RPC group netsvcs. To detect this activity, a sensor is needed at the network level that can decode RPC traffic or on the host where the communication can be detected more natively, such as Event Tracing for Windows. Using wireshark/tshark decoders, the WMI interfaces can be extracted so that WMI activity over RPC can be detected.\n\nAlthough the description details how to detect remote WMI precisely, a decent estimate has been to look for the string RPCSS within the initial RPC connection on 135/tcp. It returns a superset of this activity, and will trigger on all DCOM-related services running within RPC, which is likely to also be activity that should be detected between hosts.

Tools such as Meterpreter, Cobalt Strike, and Empire carry out automated steps to “Get System”, which is the same as switching over to the System user account. Most of these tools utilize multiple techniques to try and attain SYSTEM: in the first technique, they create a named pipe and connects an instance of cmd.exe to it, which allows them to impersonate the security context of cmd.exe, which is SYSTEM. In the second technique, a malicious DLL is injected into a process that is running as SYSTEM; the injected DLL steals the SYSTEM token and applies it where necessary to escalate privileges.

   "An adversary can use accessibility features (Ease of Access), such as StickyKeys or Utilman, to launch a command shell from the logon screen and gain SYSTEM access. Since an adversary does not have physical access to the machine, this technique must be run within Remote Desktop. To prevent an adversary from getting to the login screen without first authenticating, Network-Level Authentication (NLA) must be enabled. If a debugger is set up for one of the accessibility features, then it will intercept the process launch of the feature and instead execute a new command line. This analytic looks for instances of cmd.exe or powershell.exe launched directly from the logon process, winlogon.exe.

   "There is a significant body of work devoted to testing, verifying, and certifying the correctness of optimizing compilers. The focus of such work is to determine if source code and optimized code have the same functional semantics. In this paper, we introduce the correctness-security gap, which arises when a compiler optimization preserves the functionality of but violates a security guarantee made by source code. We show with concrete code examples that several standard optimizations, which have been formally proved correct, inhabit this correctness-security gap. We analyze this gap and conclude that it arises due to techniques that model the state of the program but not the state of the underlying machine. We propose a broad research program whose goal is to identify, understand, and mitigate the impact of security errors introduced by compiler optimizations. Our proposal includes research in testing, program analysis, theorem proving, and the development of new, accurate machine models for reasoning about the impact of compiler optimizations on security.",

   "What if online scammers weren't sure whether the user account they are targeting is really yours, or whether the information they compiled about you is real? It's worth considering whether decoy online personas might help in the quest to safeguard our digital identities and data.\n\nI believe deception tactics, such as selective and careful use of honeypots, holds promise for defending enterprise IT resources. Some forms of deception could also protect individuals against online scammers and other attackers. This approach might not be quite practical today for most people, but in the future we might find it both necessary and achievable.\n\nHuman attackers and malicious software pursue user accounts and data on-line through harvesting, phishing, password-guessing, software vulnerabilities, and various other means. How might we use decoys to confuse, misdirect, slow down and detect adversaries engaged in such activities?\n\n...\n\nThe wealth of personal details available on social networking sites allows attackers to target individuals using social engineering, secret question-guessing and other techniques. For some examples of such approaches, see The Use of Fake or Fraudulent LinkedIn Profiles and Data Mining Resumes for Computer Attack Reconnaissance.\n\nSetting up one or more fake social network profiles (e.g., on Facebook) that use the person's real name can help the individual deflect the attack or can act as an early warning of an impending attack. A decoy profile could purposefully expose some inaccurate information, while the person's real profile would be more carefully concealed using the site's privacy settings. Decoy profiles would be associated with spamtrap email addresses.\n\nSimilarly, the person could expose decoy profiles on other sites, for instance those reveal shopping habits (e.g., Amazon), musings (e.g., Twitter), skills (e.g., GitHub), travel (e.g., TripIt), affections (e.g., Pinterest), music taste (e.g., Pandora) and so on.

For a domain name that is associated with an on-line threat, the RPZ application determines a threat specification that describes a characteristic of the on-line threat. The RPZ application then generates an alias based on the domain name and the threat specification. Subsequently, the RPZ application generates a domain name system (DNS) resource record that maps the domain name to the alias, includes the resource record in the RPZ, and transmits the RPZ to a DNS name server that implements the RPZ. Upon receiving a DNS query associated with the domain name, the DNS name server generates a DNS response based on the alias.

Processes see the union of the upper and lower filesystems, but process writes are only reflected in the overlay. By providing per-process views of the filesystem using this stackable approach, a forensic analyzer can record a process's file-based activity-i.e., file creation, deletion, modification. These activities are then analyzed to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs). These indicators are then fed into a forensics analysis engine, which then quickly decides whether a subject (e.g., process, user) is malicious. If so, the system takes some proactive action to alert a proper authority, to quarantine the potential attack, or to provide other remediation. The approach enables forensic analysis without requiring file access mediation, or conducting system event-level collection and analysis, making it a lightweight, and non-intrusive solution.",

   "Return-oriented programming (ROP) has become the\nprimary exploitation technique for system compromise\nin the presence of non-executable page protections. ROP\nexploits are facilitated mainly by the lack of complete\naddress space randomization coverage or the presence\nof memory disclosure vulnerabilities, necessitating additional ROP-specific mitigations.\nIn this paper we present a practical runtime ROP exploit prevention technique for the protection of thirdparty applications. Our approach is based on the detection of abnormal control transfers that take place during\nROP code execution. This is achieved using hardware\nfeatures of commodity processors, which incur negligible runtime overhead and allow for completely transparent operation without requiring any modifications to\nthe protected applications. Our implementation for Windows 7, named kBouncer, can be selectively enabled for\ninstalled programs in the same fashion as user-friendly\nmitigation toolkits like Microsoft's EMET. The results of\nour evaluation demonstrate that kBouncer has low runtime overhead of up to 4%, when stressed with specially\ncrafted workloads that continuously trigger its core detection component, while it has negligible overhead for\nactual user applications. In our experiments with in-thewild ROP exploits, kBouncer successfully protected all\ntested applications, including Internet Explorer, Adobe\nFlash Player, and Adobe Reader.",

It records the entity's log-in behavior (conditions at log-in) and behavior once logged in to create an entity profile that helps identify behavior patterns. The system compares new entity behavior with the entity profile to determine a risk score and a confidence level for the behavior. If the risk score and confidence level indicate a credible identity fraud risk at log-in, the system can require more factors of authentication before log-in succeeds. If the system detects risky behavior after log-in, it can take remedial action such as ending the entity's session, curtailing the entity's privileges, or notifying a human administrator.",

For example, a method can include determining a deception characteristic of a deception mechanism and determining a production characteristic of the production system. The method can further include determining an additional service or a modification of an existing service of the production system using the deception characteristic and the production characteristic. In some cases, the additional service and/or the modification can be a deterrent to potential attackers of the production system.

Engineering-based solutions are essential to managing the growing complexity, dynamicity, and interconnectedness of today’s systems, as exemplified by cyber-physical systems and systems-of-systems, including the Internet of Things. This publication addresses the engineering-driven perspective and actions necessary to develop more defensible and survivable systems, inclusive of the machine, physical, and human components that compose the systems and the capabilities and services delivered by those systems. It starts with and builds upon a set of well-established International Standards for systems and software engineering published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and infuses systems security engineering methods, practices, and techniques into those systems and software engineering activities. The objective is to address security issues from a stakeholder protection needs, concerns, and requirements perspective and to use established engineering processes to ensure that such needs, concerns, and requirements are addressed with appropriate fidelity and rigor, early and in a sustainable manner throughout the life cycle of the system.",

The RMF includes activities to prepare organizations to execute the framework at appropriate risk management levels. The RMF also promotes near real-time risk management and ongoing information system and common control authorization through the implementation of continuous monitoring processes; provides senior leaders and executives with the necessary information to make efficient, cost-effective, risk management decisions about the systems supporting their missions and business functions; and incorporates security and privacy into the system development life cycle. Executing the RMF tasks links essential risk management processes at the system level to risk management processes at the organization level.

   "This volume introduces concepts to support automated assessment of most of the security controls in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53. Referencing SP 800-53A, the controls are divided into more granular parts (determination statements) to be assessed. The parts of the control assessed by each determination statement are called control items. The control items are then grouped into the appropriate security capabilities. As suggested by SP 800-53 Revision 4, security capabilities are groups of controls that support a common purpose. For effective automated assessment, testable defect checks are defined that bridge the determination statements to the broader security capabilities to be achieved and to the SP 800-53 security control items themselves. The defect checks correspond to security sub-capabilities—called sub-capabilities because each is part of a larger capability. Capabilities and sub-capabilities are both designed with the purpose of addressing a series of attack steps. Automated assessments (in the form of defect checks) are performed using the test assessment method defined in SP 800-53A by comparing a desired and actual state (or behavior).",

   "Buffer overflow attacks continue to be a major security problem and detecting attacks of this nature\nis therefore crucial to network security. Signature based network based intrusion detection systems (NIDS)\ncompare network traffic to signatures modelling suspicious or attack traffic to detect network attacks. Since\ndetection is based on pattern matching, a signature modelling the attack must exist for the NIDS to detect it, and\nit is therefore only capable of detecting known attacks. This paper proposes a method to detect buffer overflow\nattacks by parsing the payload of network packets in search of shellcode which is the remotely executable\ncomponent of a buffer overflow attack. By analysing the shellcode it is possible to determine which system\ncalls the exploit uses, and hence the operation of the exploit. Current NIDS-based buffer overflow detection\ntechniques mainly rely upon specific signatures for each new attack. Our approach is able to detect previously\nunseen buffer overflow attacks, in addition to existing ones, without the need for specific signatures for each\nnew attack. The method has been implemented and tested for buffer overflow attacks on Linux on the Intel x86\narchitecture using the Snort NIDS.",

The requestor's address, and the server's address are checked against a access control list. If either address is invalid, the proxy closes the connection. If both are valid, a new connection is setup such that both the requestor and server are transparently connected to the proxy with variable higher levels being connected in a relay mode.

   :d3fend/kb-abstract
   "Various families of malware use domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to generate a large number of pseudo-random domain names to connect to a command and control (C&C) server. In order to block DGA C&C traffic, security organizations must first discover the algorithm by reverse engineering malware samples, then generating a list of domains for a given seed. The domains are then either preregistered or published in a DNS blacklist. This process is not only tedious, but can be readily circumvented by malware authors using a large number of seeds in algorithms with multivariate recurrence properties (e.g., banjori) or by using a dynamic list of seeds (e.g., bedep). Another technique to stop malware from using DGAs is to intercept DNS queries on a network and predict whether domains are DGA generated. Such a technique will alert network administrators to the presence of malware on their networks. In addition, if the predictor can also accurately predict the family of DGAs, then network administrators can also be alerted to the type of malware that is on their networks. This paper presents a DGA classifier that leverages long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to predict DGAs and their respective families without the need for a priori feature extraction. Results are significantly better than state-of-the-art techniques, providing 0.9993 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for binary classification and a micro-averaged F1 score of 0.9906. In other terms, the LSTM technique can provide a 90% detection rate with a 1:10000 false positive (FP) rate---a twenty times FP improvement over comparable methods. Experiments in this paper are run on open datasets and code snippets are provided to reproduce the results.",

   "An adversary can remotely manipulate the registry of another machine if the RemoteRegistry service is enabled and valid credentials are obtained. While the registry is remotely accessed, it can be used to prepare a Lateral Movement technique, discover the configuration of a host, achieve Persistence, or anything that aids an adversary in achieving the mission. Like most ATT&CK techniques, this behavior can be used legitimately, and the reliability of an analytic depends on the proper identification of the pre-existing legitimate behaviors. Although this behavior is disabled in many Windows configurations, it is possible to remotely enable the RemoteRegistry service, which can be detected with CAR-2014-03-005.\n\nRemote access to the registry can be achieved via\n\n* Windows API function RegConnectRegistry\n* command line via reg.exe\n* graphically via regedit.exe\n\nAll of these behaviors call into the Windows API, which uses the NamedPipe WINREG over SMB to handle the protocol information. This network can be decoded with wireshark or a similar sensor, and can also be detected by hooking the API function.",

   "There are several ways to cause code to execute on a remote host. One of the most common methods is via the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM), which allows authorized users to remotely create and modify services. Several tools, such as PsExec, use this functionality.\n\nWhen a client remotely communicates with the Service Control Manager, there are two observable behaviors. First, the client connects to the RPC Endpoint Mapper over 135/tcp. This handles authentication, and tells the client what port the endpoint--in this case the SCM--is listening on. Then, the client connects directly to the listening port on services.exe. If the request is to start an existing service with a known command line, the the SCM process will run the corresponding command.\n\nThis compound behavior can be detected by looking for services.exe receiving a network connection and immediately spawning a child process.",

A transaction is proposed by a seller, and the buyer signals his acceptance by entering his personal authentication information comprising a PIN and at least one biometric sample, forming a commercial transaction message. The commercial transaction message is forwarded to the computer system, where the computer system compares the personal authentication information in the commercial transaction message with previously registered buyer biometric samples. If the computer system successfully identifies the buyer, a financial account of the buyer is debited and a financial account of the seller is credited, and the results of the transaction are presented to both buyer and seller. As a result of the invention, a buyer can conduct commercial transactions without having to use any tokens such as portable man-made memory devices such as smartcards or swipe cards. The invention allows buyers to quickly select one of a group of different financial accounts from which to transfer funds. The invention further indicates to the user that the authentic computer system was accessed by the use of a private code that is returned to the buyer after the identification is complete.

   "A method to identify a child process to a parent process in an operating system includes obtaining a token and login identifier from the operating system. The parent process creates a remote procedure call communications endpoint to communicate with the child process. Thereafter, a child process is spawned by the parent process. A child-initiated request to communicate with the parent process is then received by the parent process. In order to verify the identity of the child-initiated request, the parent process impersonates the child process and receives as identifier that identifies the requestor child process. The requestor process identifier and the spawned child identifier are compared. Based on the comparison, the parent process responds to the child-initiated request. In another embodiment, process identifiers are used by the parent process to verify the identity of a child process the requests communication with the parent process.",

During the spawning of a child process, a child process identifier is generated. The child process identifier is a unique identifier that can be used to identify a child process. The child process identifier is transmitted by the security system of the operating system to the parent process. The parent process keeps track of the child process identifier. When a new child-initiated communications request is received by the parent process, the parent process checks if the requesting child process identifier and the child process identifier that the parent process is tracking are the same.

Specifically, the STP data can be used in conjunction with other topography data to provide Layer-2 connectivity for nodes on a network topology. Layer-2 address mapping tables are collected from a topology mapping, and STP data is collected, along with address translation tables (ARP) tables. Using this information, switches are identified using Layer-2 address tables.

   "Keystroke dynamics or typing dynamics refers to the automated method of identifying or confirming the identity of an individual based on the manner and the rhythm of typing on a keyboard. Keystroke dynamics is a behavioral biometric, this means that the biometric factor is 'something you do'.\n\nAlready during the second world war a technique known as The Fist of the Sender was used by military intelligence to distinguish based on the rhythm whether a morse code message was send by ally or enemy. These days each household has at least one computer keyboard, making keystroke dynamics the easiest biometric solution to implement in terms of hardware.\n\nWith keystroke dynamics the biometric template used to identify an individual is based on the typing pattern, the rhythm and the speed of typing on a keyboard. The raw measurements used for keystroke dynamics are dwell time and flight time.",

Nonstandard terminal sessions and abnormal behaviors are analyzed in this technique. Abnormal behavior detection includes analysis of user input patterns in the real-time session, keyboard output and packet inspection.\n\n### Network Traffic Inspection\nNetwork traffic from internal hosts is the main concern and focus for the traffic inspection. The network traffic is collected into inspection groups. The groups of traffic are assembled into distinct pair flows (outbound/inbound) and the pair flows are further divided into sessions. Only sessions originated inside of the network are considered for the inspection. Traffic inspection includes analysis to determine if a human is involved in the session exchanges. Time-based statistics are captured for each session being analyzed by the detection engine.\n\n### Algorithm Analysis Description\nAnalysis algorithms look for patterns in the network traffic captured from the session data.  A detection engine groups the session traffic data, between the hosts, into rapid exchange instances. Analysis of rapid exchange traffic patterns can lead to the discovery of abnormal behavior which is indicative of a compromised internal host. The analysis algorithms look for patterns in the traffic which correlate to known activity (e.g., relay attacks, bot activity, bitcoin mining). Some metrics used during inspection include the following.\n\n* Number of rapid-exchange instances\n* Time interval between packets\n* Fixed cadence of traffic\n* Rhythm and direction of the initiation of instances\n* Volume of data flowing from internal to external controlling host\n* Data transfer characteristics\n* Variability in length of silent periods\n\n## Considerations\n* Full packet capture is required which can be process intensive to analyze\n* Attackers that move low and slow may blend in with existing traffic resulting in false negatives",

This technique drops reverse lookup responses where a domain name matches an entry in the blacklist, either verbatim or as a wildcard subdomain of a higher-level domain on the list. Such domain names might be unwanted because Forward Domain Name Resolution requests to such a blacklisted domain might return an unwanted IP address.\n\nThis technique is useful because relying solely on Forward Resolution Domain Blacklisting will miss instances where the domain in question is forward-resolved in a manner that is not inspected via a subsequent technique (as is likely the case if that resolution is performed with DoH (DNS over HTTPS) or DoT (DNS over TLS)). Additionally, note that responses to forward lookups of that domain are *not* necessarily equal to the original IP in the reverse lookup request, and that future lookups of a string based on this domain may even employ a less-common name resolution protocol, such as NBNS.\n\nThe DNS response can either be blocked by dropping the network traffic with an inline device, or by modifying the value of the response sent by the DNS server.  To prevent client applications from hanging on a request, it is common practice to replace malicious values, either with names like \"localhost.\" or the address of a honeypot maintained by the network administrators.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* This technique does not prevent the client from contacting the blacklisted domain or any IP addresses that it might resolve to, only from learning about this domain name via a nameserver lookup.\n* DNS response traffic can be transmitted over many different protocols, which presents a challenge to implementing methods to extract all DNS answer domain name value(s).\n  * DNS has historically used UDP port 53, with TCP port 53 instead used for responses over 512 bytes or after a lack of response over UDP.\n  * Usage of new protocols to provide confidentiality for DNS traffic, such as DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLS), complicates collection of the IP address(es) in DNS responses. These protocols have often been enabled in browser settings transparently after a browser update, with DNS requests proxied over one of these cryptographic protocols through a specified host.\n* This technique must be deployed between the application that receives the response and the server which sent the response.\n  * DNS responses sent in an encrypted manner, such as using DoH or DoT, will require interception of the TLS connections in order to determine the domain name(s) in the response.\n* Replacing the response is not effective in the case that the nameserver uses a technique to provide integrity of its responses, such as DNSSEC for DNS responses.",

   "## How it works\n\nMany application exploits rely on an attacker specifying a location in memory, which points to data or code used by the attacker.  If the addresses are changed each time the program is run, then it becomes more difficult for the attacker to determine the location that will contain the code they wish to run.\n\nImported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as \"rebasing.\"  Just as not all code is built for participation in ASLR, not all modules can be rebased; instead, modules must indicate whether they implement support for rebasing.  Such information to relocate the executable is typically stored in the \".reloc\" segment -- each of the addresses pointed to in this segment has its address increased by the amount of the offset.\n(An alternative method for relocation would be to add an amount to a global variable each time -- leading to less overhead in the module load, but more for each access.  Still another implementation could instead contain code to deference each changeable memory location on the fly, so that each of the references do not need to be updated.\n\n\n## Considerations\n\nAs the offset for each segment is constant, it is possible to guess at the value of the address given the address of another variable.  Alternatively, memory pointers may be kept around, which contain the address of another variable.\nAnother bypass technique is known as an \"egg hunt,\" whereby the attacker searches for a rather unique piece of the data or code in memory to determine its likely address.\n\nThe program needs to store these addresses for the functions somewhere.  In Linux, the PLT contains a \"trampoline\" to these addresses.  If an attacker desires to jump to the start of an existing function, they can jump directly to the trampoline anyway, and may have the opportunity to provide their own stack frame to the function with a write to the stack. If they overwrite a saved stack pointer which is loaded back into memory, or execute a function, that changes the address of a stack pointer.\n\nIf an attacker wants to inject some data into the program, for example as a parameter to a known function that is not under ASLR or a pointer to a trampoline function in the PLT, then they can repeat the data until they exceed the range of ASLR coverage, which on 32-bit systems is accomplishable in a few seconds with a heap spray.  Microsoft's EMET and Windows 10 Exploit Guard can pre-allocate particular addresses that are commonly used in heap sprays.  However, in many products, there does not seem to be nearly a complete coverage of such addresses, which only need to be executable and in the range of the heap; 0x0c0c0c0c is such an address that is commonly used for the x86 processor architecture, as when executed it only performs a numeric operation to a register four times.",

Mismatches between the two are compared since a return oriented programming attack may only be able to control or spoof the call stack and not the shadow call stack. Mismatches are counted and if the number of mismatches exceeds a certain threshold it is an indication of unauthorized activity and a security response action is performed.\n\n## Considerations\nIf the threshold for detecting a stack anomaly is low, it may not detect a return-oriented attack with just one gadget, such as a return-to-libc or return-to-plt attack.  Additionally, this technique may not detect JOP (Jump-oriented programming), as the return instruction is not executed.",

   "## How it works\n\nThis defense must be applied at compile-time, or via a patch to the program binary.  Stack Frame Canary Verification inserts instructions at the prologue and epilogue of desired functions.  In the prologue, a canary value, typically with the same size as the register size, is stored in the system of record and on the stack.  Typically, the canary is loaded to where it has a memory address just below that of the saved instruction pointer and base pointer.  In the epilogue, the canary value stored on the stack and, is compared to the canary value in the system of record.  If the values are different, other techniques such as those in Process Eviction might be invoked, such as Process Termination to end the current process, or Executable Blacklisting to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.\n\nStack Frame Canary Verification is commonly used to detect potential tampering of a saved register value on the stack before it has been restored.  Examples of registers with values commonly saved to the stack include the instruction pointer and the base pointer.\n\nThe canary should be stored between where the start of a buffer overrun is likely, and the data to protect, in cases where the buffer size increases it will overwrite the data to be protected.\n\nOn most processor architectures, including x86, x64, and ARM, a \"push\" operation to store data to the stack grows the stack towards a lower memory address.  As in these architectures, saved register values are stored to the stack at a point in time just before space is made for the local function variables, the saved register values have a higher address than that of the local function variables.  Values at increasing indexes of a buffer are written to increasing memory addresses; therefore, an overwrite in the local variable buffer could overwrite saved register values, and a stack canary between these two would be useful in detecting an overwrite.\n\nOn some other processor architectures such as the B5000, the stack grows towards increasing memory addresses, and some architectures, such as System Z and RCA1802A, stack direction can be chosen.  If the stack grows towards increasing memory addresses, while this architecture inherently provides more protection against a saved register being overwritten, other data including local function variables might be overwritten.\n\n\n## Considerations\n\nThere are several ways that the protection provided by a canary could be rendered ineffective.\n\n### Performing a malicious action before the canary is checked\n\nIf the attacker alters the memory in such a way that it performs a malicious action before the epilogue is called, then this protection will not be effective.  This includes altering the logic of the program by altering the values of local variables stored on the function stack, or by causing an exception and exploiting the exception mechanism such as the SEH (Structured Exception Handling) mechanism on Windows.\n\n### Determining the canary value\n\nDetermining the canary value is possible through reading memory either for the code used to check the canary, or from the stored canary value itself in a stack frame.\n\n### Changing the canary value\n\nA vulnerability such as a write-what-where condition that allows one to write data after the canary in the stack, would allow control of the value of the saved instruction pointer without needing to know the canary value.",

Other applications record this data in local or remote databases.\n\nThe log entry for each system call, which may reference additional information such as the date and time, and the process tree for the process which made the system call, is relayed, in real time or post-facto, to an analysis module which consults a catalog or model to determine whether the distribution matches a known-good or known-bad pattern.\n\n\n### Analysis\n\nSystem calls are analyzed with a variety of methods. Some analytics look for specific sequences of instructions, others may apply statistical methods to identify abnormal behavior. Sequences of instructions can be abstracted into conceptually higher order user activities, for example:\n\n* An attacker executes many system calls in a short period of time, with several sequences which could be used to escalate privileges.\n* Getting the contents from a URL, writing to a new file, and then executing the same file.\n* A ransomware program which either uses a loop or creates many threads to: read a specified file, encrypt its contents, create an output file with a similar name to the original file, and delete the unencrypted original.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* Duplicative or extraneous system calls may be added to malware to defeat analytics.\n* Malware could replace API hooking instructions to allow system calls to be made without being monitored.\n* A model built from a training set of system calls and related data may not be updated fast enough to detect new threats.\n\n\n[1] [Syscalls](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html)\n\n[2] [Hooking](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hooking)",

Firewall and antivirus services are popular targets for attackers. Disabling system logs will also allow an attacker's actions to go unnoticed. Analysis of logs, registries, and process monitoring help defenders locate signs of tampering. Two possible approaches are to monitor hardened system services or to monitor registry updates for modifications to security settings.",

   "## How it works\nDuring the boot process, the BIOS boot block (which with this defense enabled, is the Core Root of Trust for Measurement) measures boot components (firmware, ROM). The TPM hashes those measurements and stores the hashes in Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs).  Upon a subsequent boot, these hashes are provided to a verifier which compares the stored measurements to the new boot measurements. Integrity of the boot components is assured if they match.\n\nAttestation of the secure boot occurs when a verifying entity requests a Quote which is a concatenation of the requested PCR values, hashed and signed by the TPM's unique RSA key.  The TPM signature is trusted because the private key is stored securely in hardware and never leaves the TPM.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* The TPM does not perform the follow-on actions of acting on the PCR value information, it just provides the PCR stored information.\n* The current version of TPM is 2.0.; most existing implementations use TPM 1.2.\n\n## Citations\n[1] [TPM 2.0 Library](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-library-specification/)\n[2] [TCG Trusted Attestation Protocol (TAP) Use Cases for TPM Families 1.2 and 2.0 and DICE](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_TNC_TAP_Use_Cases_v1r0p35_published.pdf)",

   "## How it works\nTransfer Agent Authentication can be accomplished in different ways for depending on the protocol. In Email,  Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Key Identified Email (DKIM) or Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) to validate sender domain ownership.\n\n### SPF\nSPF protocol allows for mail domain owners to specify the mail servers they use when sending email. SPF requires the use of SPF records published in the Domain Name System (DNS). The records record the authorized IPs for email senders. SPF uses the return-path address for domain IP identification. Email that is forwarded may cause the return-path validation problems.\n### DKIM\nDKIM also uses a record entry in DNS for authentication but does not rely on the simple return-path for validation. A signature header is added to email and encryption is used for security. This adds an additional layer of complexity and requires that DKIM servers be configured identified cryptographic signatures. The additional complexity results in a validation process that can survive complex routing of emails.\n\n### DMARC\nDMARC is an email policy and authentication protocol that seeks to ensure that the \"From\" field of emails is not spoofed. DMARC makes use of both SPF records and DKIM published key validation. DMARC also has a decision policy framework, contained in a DMARC record, for handling of rejected email. The DMARC framework also updates DMARC domains with authentication statues for allowed senders of that domain.\n\n## Considerations\n- Additional work is required to ensure that all SPF, DKIM and DMARC records are current and up to date.\n- Maintenance of DKIM signing keys is needed.\n- Using SPF without DKIM and DMARC verifies the Return-Path domain however does not prevent spoofing of the displayed From: address.\n- Parts of an email that are not signed or verified by email authentication methods, such as the message body or the header To: and Subject: fields, can be altered or modified.\n- Email message authentication does not replace the need to do email content analysis since executables, attachments, or links or other parts of the email beyond the sender domain are not verified.",

   "## How it works\n\nURLs may contain components, for example:\n\n * scheme\n * userinfo\n * host name\n * port\n * path\n * query\n * fragment\n\nThese components are used as features in analysis algorithms.\n\nContextual information about a URL such as where it is embedded (ex. emails, files, network protocols), header, path, location, and origin information, as well as information about the content returned from the URL request, may be incorporated into an analytic for URL analysis. For example, if a URL indicates a .pdf file but an executable is actually returned, the combination of these two pieces of information indicates suspicious activity.\n\nAdditional techniques include:\n\n* Extracting features of a URL such as domain name length, ratio of consecutive consonants, percentage of digits in a domain, and number of vowels. Values for each feature are combined to develop a score for the URL.\n* Determining the probability of a character occurring in the URL given the preceding two characters. For example, for google.com, the probability of a 'g' occurring at the beginning of a word, the probability of an 'o' occurring after a \"g, the probability of an o\" occurring after a 'g' and \"o, and so forth. A dictionary or a list of known good domains is used to determine probability. Probabilities are multiplied to develop a score for the URL.\n\nURL analysis may trigger follow-on analytics such as **File Analysis**\n\n## Considerations\n\n* Volume of URLs being analyzed, combined with the speed at which they are analyzed\n* Fidelity of analysis technique at detecting brand new URLs versus analyzing URLs of established domains",
